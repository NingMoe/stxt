Hey folks,
Just purchased a new ASUS laptop today with Win 8 pre-installed.
I am trying to access the BIOS to boot from DVD to I can install
Windows 7, however for the life of me I cannot access the BIOS.
Is this a new thing? Have ASUS removed BIOS options?
Any assistance to boot from disc greatly appreciated!
I figured it out, and I'll post here for reference.
ASUS BIOS in laptops by default are locked. You need to unlock it. To
do this in Windows 8:

In Metro, go to the bottom right and in the hover menu select Settings
GO to General
Go to Advanced
Go to Boot to UEFI (or something like that).
Then it will reset the laptop and go to BIOS. In BIOS:

Disable Secure Boot
Enable Launch CSM
Save and Exit, repeat the above steps to get to BIOS.

NOW you can change the boot order.

The fact that you need to do all this work just to access the
traditional F2/Del/F12 menu demonstrates the lack of faith I have in
the computer scene.

ASUS stated their drivers are for Win 8 but they all work in Win 7.
Probably they will since the driver model is very similar.

P.S: I don't see much of a point in downgrading a computer shipped
with Win 8, because the two OS s are pretty much identical. There are
only very few compatibility issues with a handful of old hardware
devices and apps. If you dont have any such issues then you are
better off with Win 8. Like I have said in few other threads, if the
modern UI is the only reason for going back to Windows 7 then use a
3rd party start menu replacement app.
